             <h2>In Schools</h2>
            <p>Little Angel Theatre runs a targeted Schools Partnership Programme with its eight closest primary schools. Schools that are part of the programme have access to a wealth of opportunities and resources to enrich pupil artistic engagement and support teachers to enliven and enhance the curriculum. We also offer puppetry workshops to schools that are not part of the programme.</p>
